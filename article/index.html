								<b>1. COBRA Medical Insurance maybe more expensive than ACA marketplace</b><br/>
								Although it may be convenient to maintain your previous job's insurance via COBRA, you will not receive any subsidies from the Affordable Care Act. As you are no longer receiving a salaried W2 income, you have the advantage of controlling your income by selling assets at the right time.
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> Use COBRA until end of the year I retire and look at alternative from ACA marketplace.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>2. Optimize your expenditure by understanding what you are spending on.</b><br/>
								To maintain your standard of living during your first year of retirement, it's important to keep track of your spending. I followed this strategy and kept a record of my expenditures throughout my first year in retirement, which gave me valuable insight into where my money was going. In fact, I developed a tool to help people track: <a href="https://www.incomee.xyz/expense/"><b>Incomee expense modeling tool</b></a>.
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> I could start understanding my expenses a lot earlier.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>3. Use the right credit card for the right category and get 1 month free personal loan</b><br/>
								A high credit score opens up the opportunity to qualify for rewarding credit cards. By using these cards, you can essentially receive a one-month, interest-free personal loan, as you will pay for your purchases the following month. Always use a single payment account for all cards, setup auto-payment & pay full statement balance. With a proper strategy, you can enjoy discounts on all your purchases through cashback. Discounts can be stacked with coupon sites such as Rakuten (which can get you steep discount especially during Thanksgiving).
								Some people even use the technique of credit card churning for accumulating free bonuses and that can generate a couple thousand a year if done right. Here's some of my categories and cash back I am getting:
								<br/>
								<table style="width:600px">
									<tr>
										<td><b>Category</b></td>
										<td><b>Cashback %</b></td>

								<b>Hindsight:</b> Find the best card for each category.

								<b>4. Eliminate expenses for services or items you rarely use.</b><br/>
								Cable TV was one of my major entertainment expenses, costing $240 per month for services I wasn't fully utilizing. I made the switch to an internet-only plan with a free streaming box, which provided me with similar content as before, and my bill dropped to $80 per month. This change resulted in an annual savings of nearly $2,000.
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> I could have cut Cable TV a lot sooner.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>5. Get groceries / snacks / gasoline from Costco.</b><br/>
								Prior to retirement, we utilized Costco but not as frequently as we do now. Since retiring, we have made Costco our go-to for all our grocery needs, including fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, drinks, snacks, and more. According to estimates, shopping at Costco can result in a savings of 30-40% compared to other grocery stores. Additionally, the gas at Costco is typically 10-15% cheaper than other stations, making it an effective way to combat inflation. Another strategy is to buy in bulk when the item is on discount.
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> N/A
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>6. Prescription drug scam.</b><br/>
								Our medical insurance covers prescription medications with a $38 monthly co-pay. However, we've found that filling the same prescriptions at Costco Pharmacy without insurance costs only $10.5 per month. Although the savings may seem minimal in this case, they can be substantial for other medications.
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> Move to Costco Pharmacy a lot earlier.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>7. Amazon subscribe & save is a good deal.</b><br/>
								Consider signing up for Amazon's subscription service for everyday items such as floss and toothpaste to save 15% when you subscribe to five items. The best thing is you can choose your own frequency for delivery.
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> Slowly build your subscription list.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>8. Know your tax code well.</b><br/>
								Maximizing the Benefits of Not Having W2 Income: Exploring Tax Advantages through Proper Planning. 
								<ul>
									<li>Take advantage of a 0% long-term capital gain tax on up to $89.5k (for joint filers) by including asset sales and dividends. </li>
									<li>Utilize strategies such as converting a 401k to a Roth IRA (backdoor roth conversion) to further increase savings.</li>
									<li>Even when you are retired, you can do side gig like apps, web sites, youtube or part-time consulting. First deduct business expenses, next contribute all those side income as SOLO 401k up to $61k ($121k if joint ownership with spouse) so it is entirely pre-tax. </li>
									<li>If you are investing municipal funds (those pay good amount) in retirement account like IRA/401k, ensure it is taxable municipal funds.</li>
									<li>Rental property - when you factor in mortgage interest, repairs, depreciations & property management fees, you probably don't have much of rental income left but that means no tax either. The real win over time is that you will own more asset and can sell at appreciated value 15-20 years later. </li>
								</ul>
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> Plan your capital gain realization carefully.
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>9. With kids? 529 plan or UTMA?</b><br/>
							Maximizing Savings with 529 Plans and UTMA Accounts: An Overview. Parents can contribute $16k each for a total of $32k without incurring tax consequences. 529 plans, taxed initially, grow tax-free and can be utilized exclusively for education expenses and transferred between children. Unused balances can be transferred to a Roth account.
							<br/>
							UTMA accounts serve as joint accounts with children, offering tax-free capital gains up to $1.1k. Upon reaching the age of 18 and with limited child tax credits available, it becomes more advantageous for children, as students with limited income, to file their own taxes, resulting in a 0% tax on capital gains up to $12.95k (standard deduction). Utilizing UTMA accounts can provide additional tax benefits.
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> Do both plan.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>10. Boring and simple is better for investments.</b><br/>
								Investment experts emphasize the importance of diversification, yet many individuals make the mistake of relying on their 401k administrator for costly high-fee funds or placing too much emphasis on a limited portfolio of stocks or alternative investments such as cryptocurrency. A safer strategy is to invest in the overall market through low-cost funds such as VTI or VOO, which track the S&P and offer a low expense ratio (0.03%) while providing the benefit of dividend income. Set those dividend income to auto-reinvest into the same funds for dollar cost average over time.
								<br/>
								<b>Hindsight:</b> Focus more on market wide funds with low expense and produce dividends.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Bonus.</b> Anticipate similar expenses post-retirement.<br/>
